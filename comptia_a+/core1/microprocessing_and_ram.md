## Microprocessing - Objective 3.5
> Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, CPUs and add-on cards

## What is a CPU?

**CPU** - central processing unit
* 8 bits == byte
* machine language
* general purpose register, 
* intel 8088
* **clock** kinda like the doorbell outside the *'man in a box'*
* many *'man'* or the cpu, a pipeline or a core, on modern cpu it could be 4 steps or 16 steps
* to speed up the cpu, its to hit the clock faster. 

#### Quick Review
* CPU are the chips used to run programs
* Every CPU has a internal features to process commands
* Every CPU runs code based on a specific machine language
* CPUs use pipelines to optimize the processing commands

## CPU speeds and cores
* **Herz** is one time per second
* **Giga hertz** a billion times per second 
* When talking about CPU speed is were taking cpu top speed
* quartz oscillator acts like a metronone and push the clock
* motherboards tops out at about 400mhz
* clock multiplying
* overclocking - pushing the system 
* multiple cores
* hyperthreading - one super smart pipleine, that can handle two incoming pcs of codes at the same time,
