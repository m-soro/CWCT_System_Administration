**What is packet tracer?**

*It is a cisco software, used to model/build/design networks virtually*

What's my understanding of cisco packet tracer as of 10/28/21 @ 7:05 pm?

> As I am writing this, I am in a zoom call with my cohort for the A+ course, it's been very busy at work and have not had a chance to further explore packet tracer.
> Upon watching some youtube videos while I was on the subway, I learned the difference between **HUB** and **SWITCH**. 

**HUB** VS **SWITCH**

A hub has no memory and less secure, since it broadcasts the packet to the whole network, whereas switch is an intelligent device, it has a memory and knows the IP address of the exact receiving computer.
