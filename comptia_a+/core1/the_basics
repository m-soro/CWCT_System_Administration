Phsyical Safety - Objective 4.4
EMP - Electro Magnetic Pulse, transfer of electro magnetic energy from one source to another that causes damage
Safety goggles and air filter mask

Three types of EMP:
Electrostatic discharge (ESD) - it can destroy components
Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) - an electric motor next to network cables, can cause problems with the transmission, a big magnetic field can wipe off hard drives
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) - prevents transmissions, or slow down transmission

Prevent shock to sensitive components using:
Use antistatic bag
Disconnect computer before working
Use Antistatic/ESD mat
Anti static wrist strap


Tools of the trade - Objective 2.8 
Given a scenario Use appropriate tools
>Mike has a phone and #2 philip screwdriver
PC repair toolkits are available, mobile toolkits, volt-ohm meter to test input voltage, always carry thumb drives

Given a scenario, use the best practice methodology to resolve problems
Always condider corporate policies, procedures, impacts before implementing changes
Step 1: Identify the problem, Inquire regarding enviornmental or infrastructure changes, review system and application logs
Step 2: Establish a theory of probable cause(question the obvious)
Step 3: test the theory to determine the cause, if theory is not confirmed, try another theory, escalate the issue
Step 4: Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution
